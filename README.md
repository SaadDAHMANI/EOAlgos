>## Supported algorithms 

>### 1. Gravitational Search Algorithm "GSA"
* Refer to the [GSA article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025509001200) for more information about the algorithm.
* The GSA code is implemented based on [GSA matlab source code](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27756-gravitational-search-algorithm-gsa).

>### 2. Hybrid algorithm of Particle Swarm optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm "PSOGSA"
* It is implemented based on : PSOGSA source code v3.0, Generated by SeyedAli Mirjalili, 2011. 
Adopted from: S. Mirjalili, S.Z. Mohd Hashim, A New Hybrid PSOGSA Algorithm for Function Optimization, in IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Application?ICCIA 2010), China, 2010, pp. 374-377
* Refer to [Matlab zip files here.](www.alimirjalili.com/SourceCodes/PSOGSA.zip)

>### 3. Grey Wolf Optimizer "GWO"
* Refer to the [GWO article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997813001853) for more information about the algorithm.
* The implemented version is based on the [original matlab source code](http://www.alimirjalili.com/GWO.html).
* GWO is implemented as **StandardGWO** version.
